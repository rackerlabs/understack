# We don't want to enable OpenStack Helm's

# post-install,post-upgrade which in ArgoCD
# maps to PostSync. However the deployments
# and statefulsets in OpenStack Helm
# depend on the jobs to complete to become
# healthy. Which they cannot because they are in
# the post step and not in the main step.
# Turning this on results in the keys jobs
# editing the annotation which deletes the item
