# This role was sourced from the argo-workflows installation manifest, and is included to provide the neccessary RBAC
# configuration for a namespaced argo-workflows/events install. Typically this role would be created within the
# argo-workflows namespace, however since this installation is configured to use the argo-events namespace, this role
# will need to be created here.
