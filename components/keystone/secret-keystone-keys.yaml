# Explicitly define this secret as empty so that OpenStack Helm does not
# create it for us because it will put helm hook annotations on the one
# it generates. This causes the secret to get re-generated by subsequent
# helm runs. Specifically ArgoCD cleans up anything with a helm hook
# before applying the chart again. We do not want this to go away and
# instead allow other jobs to update it so it should persist.
# TODO: remove after https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/openstack-helm/+/959251 is released.
