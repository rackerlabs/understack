annotations:
  # we need to modify the annotations on OpenStack Helm
  # jobs because they use helm.sh/hooks: post-install,post-upgrade
  # which means they will get applied in the post phase which
  # is after the API deployment. With standard helm this works
  # out because it just orders how things are applied but with
  # ArgoCD it will wait until the sync phase is successful.
  # Unfortunately the API deployments need several jobs to occur
  # before it will go successful like creating the keystone user,
  # service, endpoints and syncing the DB. These jobs also have
  # a helm.sh/hook-weight to order them which is good but by moving
  # them to the sync phase the weight is now wrong with resources
  # they depend on like secrets and configmaps so we need to
  # override them to 0 because there is no way in OpenStack Helm
  # to set annotations on deployments and daemonssets nicely.
  # Other jobs might need to be moved as well. We do this by
  # moving them to the sync phase. Additionally since the jobs
  # are using fixed names and not generated names for each run
  # ArgoCD attempts to edit them but they have immutable fields
  # so we must force the replacement instead of attempting to diff them.
  # Lastly the hook-delete-policy controls the finalizer which
  # prevents the deletion of the job. In this case we're saying
  # the old job needs to be removed before applying the new one
  # which gets around the immutable case above.
