# Overview

The WorkflowTemplates provided in this directory were created to establish commonly used Workflows to be consumed by other, likely larger, Workflows. For example,
the nautobot-api WorkflowTemplate is consumed by the get-device-nautobot WorkflowTemplate, to produce it's own output containing information on a Nautobot Device,
which can then be consumed by future WorkflowTemplates.

## Setup

The Nautobot Workflows require a ConfigMap.

```bash
kubectl -n argo create configmap nautobot '--from-literal=url=https://nautobot.local'
```

## Caveats

Currently Understack is not including any sort of secret store, outside of what is natively provided by Kubernetes. As such, these workflows make a couple of assumptions:

- Credentials will be mounted from a Kubernetes Secret.
- How those credential Secrets are created is up to you.

`workflowtemplates/get-obm-creds.yaml` and the placeholder secret provided in `deps/` are strictly that, placeholder. They have been provided to allow the workflows to execute,
however they will likely fail until a proper get-obm-creds Workflow is created.

## Example
```bash
argo -n argo-events submit --from workflowtemplate/get-device-nautobot --parameter hostname=host.domain.local
