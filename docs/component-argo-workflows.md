# Argo Workflows

[Argo Workflows][argo-workflows] was chosen as our workflow / orchestration service. It runs natively inside a
Kubernetes environment and easily integrates with [Argo Events][argo-events]. Understack will be deployed with the
set of WorkflowTemplates below.

## WorkflowTemplates

| WorkflowTemplate      | Description                                               | Input                   | Output     |   |
|---------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|---|
| get-device-nautobot   | Return Device Information from Nautobot                   | device_id               | device     |   |
| get-bmc-creds         | Get the credentials for the target Device                 | device_id               | secret     | * |
| get-bmc-ip            | Get BMC IP address for target Device                      | device_id               | ip         |   |
| nautobot-api          | HTTP Template Workflow to query the Nautobot API          | method,nautobot_url,uri | result     |   |
| bmc-sync-creds        | Sync's a devices BMC password with what we have on record | device_id               |            |   |

\* WorkflowTemplate which requires a manual / custom implementation.

As Understack develops, there may be underlying / dependant services which are not included, and require some of the
included WorkflowTemplates to be manually implemented to work in your environment. For example, the get-bmc-creds
WorkflowTemplate will need to be written to communicate with whatever service you're using to store your device
credentials.

## Setup

The included Workflows include references to configuration ConfigMaps and Secrets.

### Nautobot

The Secret will be defined by the External Secret.

```bash
kubectl -n argo create configmap nautobot '--from-literal=url=https://nautobot.local'
```

## Security

Authorization is handled by Kubernetes' RBAC services. Workflows are run with the context of a given Kubernetes Service
Account. We've provided the `workflow` Service Account, which has been granted access to the necessary Kubernetes
resources, to run the provided WorkflowTemplates.

### argo-python

To facilitate the ability to pass data securely between Workflows the [argo-python][argo-python] Class was written.
This Python Class writes Kubernetes Secrets directly to the Kubernetes API from the Workflow's Pod, allowing these
Secrets to be securely mounted into a subsequent Workflow's environment.

By default these Secrets are created with an ownerReference set to the Workflow which created them, which allows
them to be garbage collected when that Workflow is terminated. The ownerReference requires details about the
Workflow to be passed in. This is available in the Workflow from the
[workflow variable](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variables/#global).

An example WorkflowTemplate demonstrating argo-python usage can be found
[here](https://github.com/rackerlabs/understack/blob/main/workflows/argo-events/workflowtemplates/get-bmc-creds.yaml).

### Argo CLI

Argo Workflows has a CLI and the installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/).
