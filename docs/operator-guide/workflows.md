## Troubleshooting

### Cleaning up failed and errored workflows

When an argo workflow fails, the failed workflow remains in argo until it's cleaned up.
If prometheus monitoring is enabled (it's enabled by default in understack), prometheus
will fire alerts which look like this:

``` text
[FIRING:4] argo-events (monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus)
Alerts Firing:
Labels:
alertname = KubePodNotReady
namespace = argo-events
pod = keystone-event-project-4ksc7
prometheus = monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus
severity = warning
Annotations:
description = Pod argo-events/keystone-event-project-4ksc7 has been in a non-ready state for longer than 15 minutes.
```

We can then examine the argo workflow logs and kubernetes pod logs to investigate
and resolve the failure reasons.

Once we are done investigating, we can clean up the failed and error workflows,
which will resolve the prometheus alerts and delete the errored kubernetes pods
for the workflows.

Find the problem argo workflows:

``` bash
argo -n argo-events list --status Failed,Error
```

We should see something like this:

``` bash
 î‚° argo -n argo-events list --status Failed,Error

```

You can delete a single workflow:

``` bash
argo -n argo-events delete $workflow
```

For example:

``` bash
argo -n argo-events delete enroll-server-zd4mr
```

With a simple for loop we can delete all the failed and errored workflows:

``` bash
for workflow in `argo -n argo-events list --status Failed,Error | egrep "Failed|Error" | awk '{print $1}'`; do
    argo -n argo-events delete $workflow ;
done
```
