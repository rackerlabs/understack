-   :material-cloud:{ .lg} __What is UnderStack?__

    UnderStack is an opinionated installation of OpenStack centered around Ironic
    and related services to be able to provision bare metal hardware to be
    consumable by genestack for the full OpenStack suite.

    The requirements are a Kubernetes cluster, which these docs will contain
    information about building different clusters and then a pile of bare metal
    systems that can be ingested into the stack to be available to be consumed via
    Openstack Ironic.
