# Vision

Understack aims to provide an opinoniated installation of OpenStack Ironic and related
services to allow management of bare metal environments efficiently, rapidly, consistently and cost-effectively.

## Components

- Data Center Infrastructure Management
- IP Address Management
- Hardware Provisioning
- Hardware Lifecycle
- Hardware Monitoring

The effort aims to be OpenStack centric with supporting services and systems. The aim
for the deployment platform is to be centered on Kubernetes.

## End User Experience

The end user experience is expected to be an API first model centered around OpenStack
APIs allowing users to use existing OpenStack based tooling. Servers will be available
via Nova so that there can be defined flavors and the user gets a machine that fulfills
their needs.

## Operator Experience

Operators like DC techs and network engineering will have immediate view into the system
assets and if they are consumed or not consumed.

## Scale

The overall scale of one system is expected to be at a multiple data center with multiple
fabrics in each data center. This is the differiator between other tools available
today.
