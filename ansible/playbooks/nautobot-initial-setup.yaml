- name: Initial setup of a Nautobot Dev Instance
  connection: local
  hosts: nautobot
  gather_facts: false

  # The goal after this playbook runs is to have a set of devices that can
  # be tested against. For a Device to be defined in Nautobot you must
  # first have a Device Role, a Device Type, and a Rack. For a Device Type
  # to be defined you must first have a Manufacturer. For a Rack to be
  # defined you must first have a Site. The Rackspace plugin to read
  # data from CORE and Location Manager can provide some of these but
  # that involves enabling Jobs from our plugin first. To be able to
  # run our Jobs we need to populate some Secrets as well.
  #
  # To visualized linearly we need to instanitate the following:
  # - Jobs
  # - Secrets
  # - Locations
  # - Racks
  # - Tenants
  # - Device Role
  # - Manufacturer
  # - Device Type
  # - Devices
